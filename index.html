In Japan in 2015, Luigi and other Nintendo characters' outfits were given redesigns to promote the New Nintendo 3DS. Luigi also has 3 titles in his series, Luigi's Mansion, the final one coming out in 2019.
In the 1987 game, Wrecking Crew, Luigi's outfit was pink overalls and in the Japan-exclusive Mario Bros. movie, his cap and pants were blue and his shirt was yellow. In early games, Luigi was just a recolor
of Mario. In Mario Power Tennis, after winnning as Luigi, Mario will go up to congratulate Luigi, before Luigi looks down to see that Mario stepped on his shoe. This scene ended up with people disliking Mario's
character entirely. In 2013, Nintendo's CEO, Satoru Iwata, declared that the year would be known as The Year Of Luigi, with games focusing on Luigi or with Luigi cameos throughout.
