Luigi is Mario's brother with a less familiar face.

<h1>Miscellaneous Luigi facts</h1>
<p>In Japan in 2015, Luigi and other Nintendo characters' outfits were given redesigns to promote the New Nintendo 3DS. Luigi also has 3 titles in his series, Luigi's Mansion, with the final one coming out in 2019.
In the 1987 game, Wrecking Crew, Luigi's outfit was pink overalls and in the Japan-exclusive Mario Bros. movie, his cap and pants were blue and his shirt was yellow. In early games, Luigi was just a recolor
of Mario. In Mario Power Tennis, after winnning as Luigi, Mario will go up to congratulate Luigi, before Luigi looks down to see that Mario stepped on his shoe. This scene ended up with people disliking Mario's
character entirely. In 2013, Nintendo's CEO, Satoru Iwata, declared that the year would be known as The Year Of Luigi, with games focusing on Luigi or with Luigi cameos throughout. In Super Smash Bros. 64 and Super
Smash Bros. Melee, Luigi's voice was Mario's voice with a higher pitch. In the Smash Bros. series, Luigi had to be unlocked in each game, with the exception of Super Smash Bros. 4.</p>

<p>In the Year of Luigi, the Nintendo service, Club Nintendo, released a Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon figure for 1,500 coins. These figures in turn, sold out rather quickly. Dr. Luigi was one of the games released during
the year of Luigi. It was essentially the game, Dr. Mario, with a Luigi overlay and it featured the Luigi version of Dr. Mario and L-shaped pills. It also had a mode where the Wii U gamepad's touch screen needed to
be used, and the game also offered a mode like the original Dr. Mario.</p>
<h1>Luigi games</h1>
<p>The first Super Mario game starring Luigi as the main character was Mario is Missing which came out in 1993 and was widely disliked among Nintendo fans. Luigi's next game, Luigi's Mansion revived the series of Luigi
games as it soon became a Mario series classic. When the Year of Luigi came around in 2013, Luigi got multiple games centered around him. Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon was one of these; in my opinion, it wasn't as much of
a classic as the first game, but it's still a great sequel. A popular Super Mario Odyssey mod named "Super Luigi Odyssey" is a version of the original game, except Mario's sprites and voice clips have been replaced
with that of Luigi. Until February, 2018, Luigi was absent from Odyssey, and shortly after the game's release, Nintendo Direct announced a new mode called Luigi's Balloon World. This game wasn't centered around Luigi,
but it's a very unfamiliar Mario game; the name of the game is Mario Excitebike and it was like Super Mario Kart and the game, Excitebike, combined. In 2005, Mario Party Advance was released and was the worst selling
Mario Party game ever. The game only had four characters, Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and Yoshi, and there could only be one player on the board. The game was also a race to avoid running out of rolls.</p>
<h1>Luigi merchandise</h1>
<p>Aside from games with the green-clad plumber, Luigi also has a considerable amount of merchandise. Some notable plushies of him include the Mario Party 5 plush set, a phush in which Luigi has his Poltergust 5000
on his back, another Luigi's Mansion plush featuring Luigi with his hands to his face and a scared expression, and the Kellytoy Luigi plush. Much rarer plushies include the previously mentioned Mario Party 5 plush,
which is well-known for its rarity. Another rare plush set with Luigi is a set of Super Mario World plushies. A set of rare Mario plushies that I was lucky enough to receive is a Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Toad, and Koopa
Troopa New Super Mario Bros. Wii set. This next plush isn't Luigi, but rather, his rival, Waluigi. There is a rare set of Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Baby Wario, and Baby Waluigi plushies. I feel that they might be bootlegs,
as Baby Waluigi doesn't exist in the official Mario universe. A very rare Princess Peach plush was released around 1997 with a Mario wing cap plush, Luigi, and Toad set. Another rare Luigi is a plush of Baby Luigi in 
a diaper, which is based off the game, Yoshi's Island. There are two rather unsettling Mario and Luigi plushies based off of the first Mario game, Donkey Kong, and the original Super Mario Bros.. A strange Luigi plush 
in which Pikachu is dressed as Luigi has also appeared. Some of the infamous Nintendo plushies come straight from the toy company, Kellytoy. Most of the interest in this company involves its Super Mario prototypes. I 
believe that rare Luigi prototypes from Kellytoy exist, but I haven't seen much news on them.</p>

        <h2>Luigi cameos</h2>
        <p>Luigi has had plenty of appearances in games outside of Super Mario. One of the most notable is in Kirby Super Star when Kirby is fighting King Dedede. Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad, and a few other 
        characters appear to cheer on Kirby. Another appearance is in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, where there are 2 villager NPCs that bear a resemblance to Mario and Luigi. In The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of 
        Time, there are paintings of various Mario characters such as Mario, Luigi, and Yoshi inside Princess Zelda's castle. In the movie theater in Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga, there are posters advertising movies
        of different Nintendo characters and one of them has Mario and Luigi on it.

        <h2>Luigi outfits</h2>
        <p>Luigi has had many different outfits that he's worn throughout his time in the gaming world. His most iconic clothing choice is a green hat, shirt, blue overalls, brown shoes, and white gloves. In Japan, in 1986, 
        a Super Mario anime was released and as mentioned before, Luigi's outfit was a blue hat and overalls with a yellow shirt. In Super Mario Bros. and other games in the 1980s, Luigi had a white hat and overalls, but he 
        still kept his classic green shirt. In Super Mario Odyssey's Luigi's Balloon World update, Luigi looked the same, but he had a light green polka dot tie and a black backpack littered with stickers. Luigi's appearance 
        also changes with almost every powerup he collects. In the game, Super Mario Strikers, every character's outfit was altered to fit a soccer player's outfit. Luigi's outfit had navy blue jersey sleeves and the middle of 
        Luigi's jersey was green with the number 2 under a lightning bolt. Luigi had blue shorts with green tips, blue and green wristbands, and green and blue shoes.

<h2>Programmer's note</h2>
<p>Thanks for the time to visit this site! I'm still pretty crappy with coding so just bear with me on it. This took a while and yeah, I guess I've been rambling. If I feel like it, I'll make a site around My Hero Academia, Cuphead,
or Doki Doki Literature Club, but I can't promise anything.
